ADVi3pp-LCD-4.0.3.img.zip
This is the LCD firmware for the Wanhao i3 Plus LCD. This is a stock image from the ADVi3++ Project. Use a program like Etcher.io to burn the img file contained inside to a SD card that is 512MB or larger. Then insert the SD with the image into the printer LCD and turn it on. It will take about 5 minutes to update and cycle through the images as it flashes.
